# Succulent-website
This is a simple succulent shopping website.
It's purpose is to be familar with connecting database with html page, and get data from database to show on the website.

The website would look exactly like this one: https://juanni0210.github.io/succulent-website/. This project is a rewrite in JavaScript to achieve the same effect since GitHub does not support php file.
